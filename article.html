      <p class="text">I am now studying about front-end development at <span>Skillvul</span> and this website (My very first own website that I developed by myself) is one of the assignments. Yes it's still very simple, but I am looking forward to learn more so that I can improve this website into something much more presentable than it's current state now. Why did I choose front-end development? I studied UI/UX last semester and the reason i'm studying front-end development is because I would like to develop the designs i've made as a UI/UX designer. I am also having an internship at <span>PT. Transkon Jaya Tbk</span> currently at the IT Support position.<br><br>Well this is as much I can actually write for now. I will be adding and editing more to this article as soon as more interesting things happen to me! If you are interested in reading more articles that I have written, you can check my <a class="art-link" href="https://medium.com/@ivan_luis030602">MEDIUM</a> page here!</p>
